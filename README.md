# Delivery Fee Calculator - Frontend

## Introduction
This project is a solution for Wolt Engineering 2022 Assignment. The application calculates the delivery fee according to the instructions in this repo https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-summer-intern-2022. 

## Motivation
At the end of 2021, I didn't know React and was a beginner in Javascript. I came across the Wolt Engineering Internship position and the assignment thaat year required React knowledge. I tried to learn React and did the assignment in 3 days but I was not chosen to be the intern that year. 

After continuously learning and practicing coding, this year, I decided to challenge myself once again and I'm so happy that I could finish this project. 

Thank you Wolt team very much for the assignment once again!
